# Pyramids

Build some test pyramids.

The main idea behind this repo is to take the unit, integration and acceptance tests of a project
and construct a visualization of a test pyramid based on the number of tests.

### Pyramids are still being constructed!
In other words, work in progress..
In other other words, tests may fail.

## Running

```shell
pyramid build
```

For help:

```shell
pyramid --help
```
